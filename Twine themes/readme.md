## Twine Desktop 2.7 CSS Customizations:

# Obsidian-like circular nodes (dark mode):
This converts the passage boxes into circular nodes that you can color using the colored tags in an obsidian-like style, adds a small halo to the selected node (picture below), and shows passage content when hovering the node.  The Twine app saves tag order so you can even make different multi-colored nodes using the same colors in a different order.
