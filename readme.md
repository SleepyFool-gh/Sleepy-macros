A soon-to-be-filled library of SugarCube macros of dubious value

&nbsp;

### Macro list:

  - [SELECT](https://github.com/SleepyFool-gh/Sleepy-macros/tree/main/SELECT%20macro) - creates a link which removes all other links in its group when clicked

### Other resources:
  
  - [Hituro macros](https://github.com/hituro/hituro-makes-macros)
  - [Maliface macros](https://github.com/MalifaciousGames/Mali-s-Macros)
  - [Chapel macros](https://twinelab.net/custom-macros-for-sugarcube-2/#/)

### WIP:

  - [P] - wrap blocks of unformatted text into their own separated `<p>` elements
