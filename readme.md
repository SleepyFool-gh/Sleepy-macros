### Macro list:

  - [divider](https://github.com/SleepyFool-gh/Sleepy-macros/tree/main/divider-macro) - creates a divider while hiding old dividers created this way
  - [p](https://github.com/SleepyFool-gh/Sleepy-macros/tree/main/p-macro) - automatically wrap enclosed chunks of text into `<p>` elements
  - [select](https://github.com/SleepyFool-gh/Sleepy-macros/tree/main/select-macro) - creates a link which removes all other links in its group when clicked
