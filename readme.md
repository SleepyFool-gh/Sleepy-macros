### Macro list:

  - [select](https://github.com/SleepyFool-gh/Sleepy-macros/tree/main/select%20macro) - creates a link which removes all other links in its group when clicked
  - [newhr](https://github.com/SleepyFool-gh/Sleepy-macros/tree/main/newhr%20macro) - creates an `<hr>` while simultaneously removing old `<hr>`'s created this way

#### WIP:

  - P - wrap blocks of unformatted text into their own separated `<p>` elements
